# The First Class
I attended my first Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) class on May 20th, 2019 with a friend from work who was also interested in trying out the sport. I'd always been loosely interested in trying Jiu-Jitsu, especially after listening to media personalities like Jocko Willink, Joe Rogan, and Lex Fridman discuss it on various podcasts. 

There's a lot of posts on the internet already about how to approach your first class, what to do, and what to expect - so I won't go into detail here. My only real tip is that I was likely less nervous about my first class since I was attending with a friend. Sometimes experiencing new situations is easier with a buddy.

Other than that, I don't even remember my first class. I didn't take notes. It's a blur, lost to time. I likely rolled around like a fool in the loaner Gi that was given to me. The first class was a free trial. The academy offered us both an additional trial day which we attended the same week. We signed up for 2x a week adult classes that day, and began our training the following Monday (May 27th, 2019).

# The Academy
My coworker/friend/now BJJ training partner and I decided to enroll at [Guerrilla Jiu-Jitsu Academy - Pleasanton](https://www.guerrillajiujitsu.com/) (GJJ). 
We selected this academy based on several criteria:
1. Proximity / Location
2. Quality of Instructors
3. Abundance of Classes for Children
4. Other positive reviews online (Yelp, etc.)

The third bullet probably seems like the strangest one. Our logic was that if the instructors were friendly enough to handle 30+ kids at once in a BJJ class, they probably also had the tolerance and patience to coach a couple of cybersecurity knuckleheads with 0 experience in martial arts/wrestling.

Ultimately, this post isn't meant to be a review of GJJ, but I would be remiss without giving a brief shout-out to the school. The three primary adult instructors for the Pleasanton academy (Dave Camarillo, James Terry, Danny Bohigian) are all excellent. The staff is friendly and easy to talk to. The facilities are clean and well maintained. The people (other students), regardless of belt level, are all friendly and open to rolling (to be fair, one of the academy slogans is 'Train With Everyone'). I'd recommend this school to anyone looking to get into the sport.

# The Journey (So Far)
I don't think I'm particularly good at BJJ, and that's okay. I'm generally athletic enough, but I'm certainly not the strongest, fastest, or most coordinated (I often Joke that I'm BJJ dyslexic because I do every move backwards at least twice). I do have some advantages in that I have long limbs, am naturally fairly flexible, and I'm average height. 

If I want to get better at the sport, I need to continue to regularly attend class (Not counting my current absence streak due to COVID-19 shutdowns), focus on strength and conditioning (Running/Burpees, etc.), and watch some more BJJ YouTube videos in my free time to keep my mind sharp on alternate techniques.

Ultimately, I'm doing BJJ as a hobby. I'm doing it for fun, for exercise, and to learn a useful skill (self defense). I never plan on competing, and I have no burning desires to be promoted or attain a higher belt rank any time soon. I think what I like the most about BJJ is the philosophy and mental benefits.

#### Timeline 2019-2020
* May 2019 - Signed Up 0 Stripe White Belt

# The Philosophy & Mindset
You will read a lot online about people evangelizing BJJ a bit as a cure for depression and as a major stress reliever. 

I agree with them. I'm not depressed, nor do I suffer from extreme stress, but I do find myself happier after each BJJ class and attempting to strangle your friends is a guaranteed stress relief valve. I also believe there's benefits to keeping in shape (not that I try very hard in this area sometimes...) so bundling those things up is a recipe for good things.

I think a big part of this is the 'Flow' of BJJ. The following video explains this philosophy very well:

    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
    allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</div>
<br>

There's a certain aspect to BJJ that involves ego, self-consciousness, mindfulness, breaking out of comfort zones, and challenging yourself to do something new, and try something hard. To fail, and to learn, and to try again until you find success. I'm certainly not a philosopher, but I appreciate BJJ for having a little bit of all of these things wrapped into it.

# Miscellaneous Musings

#### Recovery & Supplements
Generally, before class I take three pills: Beet Root, BAA, and an L-Arginine.
Do they do anything? I'm not sure, I take them because they're supposed to help with blood flow, etc. Worst case, I get some vitamins. Best case, I get some placebo. 

For recovery, the only thing I do 'special' is the rare Epsom Salt bath, and some ZMA + Multi-Vitamin before bed (Mostly for the on average cooler dreams).

#### Injuries & Prevention
For me, the most common 'injury' I receive training is some bruises. Usually under my arm, but sometimes on my wrist/legs. 
After a hard class, you might be a little sore/stiff. I've jammed my fingers a few times as well. The tips of my fingers often shed the first layer of skin because I grip the Gi too hard (This sounds horrifying, but it's really not - just a light finger exfoliation experience). I certainly don't train enough (nor use my head enough offensively) to have any issues with Cauliflower ear. 

Perhaps I've been fortunate in avoiding injury, but as long as you're calm (trying not to spaz), and using 111% of your strength you should be okay. Just try to find training partners who aren't out for blood.

As far as preventative things to have on hand:
* BJJ Athletic Finger Tape
* Finger 'Buddy Loops' for Jammed Fingers
* Liquid Bandage (This is useful outside of BJJ)
* Tylenol / Advil
* A foam roller / lacrosse ball to roll out soreness / limber up before class

#### Hygiene & Laundry
Before each class I shower and brush my teeth. I try to avoid eating at least 2hrs before class (this is probably personal preference).

I wash my Gi as soon as I get home (belt included) with some regular laundry detergent and a splash of Lysol Laundry Sanitizer 0% Bleach 'Sport' liquid. I usually use a cold cycle and then air dry to avoid potential shrinkage.

#### Equipment
I wear contacts to class so I can see what the instructors are doing.

I can get claustrophobic and gag while on the mats from time to time (Not 100% sure why...). As a result, mouth guards are a big no-no for me. I bought a 1.6mm SISU Mouth Guard 'Aero' and tried it out around the house. It made me gag all the time. I'm not sure what it is, but I doubt I'll ever magically grow out of my overly sensitive gag reflex regarding foreign objects in my mouth. Sorry, teeth. I hope you all stay safe in the future. <sup>All 32 of you.</sup>

I bought a $20 JanSport 'Mesh Pack' backpack to store my Gi in and take to class with me. It fits everything really well, and gives the Gi something to breath in.

# Final Thoughts
Would I recommend you get out and try BJJ? Yes.

Although I also recognize it won't be for everyone, and that's okay too. <i class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></i>
