# About
Brendan Higgins is a Cybersecurity Engineer.

This site is just a place to record interesting things in cybersecurity, technology, programming, literature, video games, and just about anything else.

Opinions and ideas expressed here are solely my own and do not express the views or opinions of my employer or any professional affiliation that I may have.

I'll list all my certs here, but I often let them expire.  <sup style="font-size:.75em;">Certifications expiring is sort of a racket anyway.<sup>
