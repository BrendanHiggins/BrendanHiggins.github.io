Just testing out Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Why GCP? I guess I see/interact with AWS/Azure enough already, so I decided to play with GCP instead.

In total this site is using:<br>
-Google Domains purchased brendanhiggins.dev<br>
-GCP Marketplace Deployed VM 'Ghost Certified by Bitnami'<br>
-Assigned Static IP via GCP Network Services<br>
-Turned on GCP DNS API, setup new cloud zone and added NS to Google Domains<br>
-Added SSL Cert/Font Awesome to Ghost via SSH<br>
<br>
All in all, took me about two hours of trial/error and some Google searching. <i class="fab fa-sm fa-google"></i>

**07-13-2020 Update:**<br>
Ended up replacing the GCP Ghost CMS with [Jekyll](/technology/Jekyll/) and moving over to GitHub Pages.
