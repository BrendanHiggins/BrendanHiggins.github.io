Pre-2013 Book Review

<!--more-->

This certainly will not be 100% accurate, but these are titles that stand out in my mind. I've certainly forgotten loads of books I read while very young, and numerous short-stories read for school and fun.

<a href="https://brendanhiggins.dev/literature/Books/" target="_blank">Ratings Scale (5-1)</a>

# Highschool
This will be a category for books that were required reading I did for high school and my memories of them a decade later. Should be super reliable.

#### Death of a Salesman
Technically a play, but also a very thin book. Interesting tones about the "American Dream", consumerism, and family. I recommend it simply because you can read this in an afternoon. (Or watch it, I assume there's some good versions of the play around). I still think back on the themes of this book from time to time, I feel like they become more relevant into adulthood.
<hr>

#### Siddhartha
It's interesting because in the moment while I read this in school I don't remember enjoying very much. Yet, I also have fond memories of it looking back. Maybe one day I'll revisit it - it's certainly not a long novel.
<hr>

#### Frankenstein
I mean, it's Frankenstein. Not the Hollywood version, but the much more interesting literary version that has so much more depth, especially around the themes of loss, death, grief, loneliness, and general human capacity for cruelty. Can't go wrong.
<hr>

#### Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
Eh... It's certainly entertaining and it's undeniably a classic. I'm not sure if I had any major lessons learned from it. Not super high on my list of 'must read' titles, but certainly a fun adventure and a more approachable classic especially for a younger reader.
<hr>

#### The Tortilla Curtain
I distinctly recall really not enjoying this book. I actually think I listened to a bootlegged audiobook version while I played Minecraft to distract myself from the plot. Wait...what was the plot? I can't really remember, but I do remember it dealt with immigration and the narrative swapped between an immigrant and a suburban dad who may or may not have had a dog.
<hr>

#### The Scarlet Letter 
I have nightmares about this book. It was nearly impossible to read. I think I finished it? But I also think I may have skipped large sections of it because it's really bad. A for adultery and F for "Rating." Something about a meteor and some hypocritical puritans? Truly the worst book I was ever assigned in HS.
<hr>

#### Of Mice and Men
Pretty good - I enjoyed it for what it was, but not necessarily in my top 5 for "classics." I certainly would recommend it to someone interested, plus for whatever reason you see this mentioned in popular culture more often than some novels.
<hr>

#### Night
If you haven't read it, you should. It's hard to read. Not because the writing is obtuse, but because processing what Elie, his family, and everyone around him went through during the Holocaust is impossible to accurately to imagine. If you haven't read it, you absolutely should. It's mandatory reading in school for a reason.
<hr>

#### Lord of the Flies 
Maybe I was just distracted with other classes when I got around to reading this, but I struggled through the book. That's not to say I didn't like it, just that I had a hard time finding time to read it at that time in my life. The themes are interesting, the plot is good, and the general premise is realistic enough to make you give a second thought about human nature. The whole "nature" vs "nurture" argument certainly comes into play.
<hr>

#### Fahrenheit 451  
I need to revisit this novel. I read it, physically. I was a very distracted high school boy when this book was assigned in class. I'm not sure why I struggled with it so badly. The themes and setting are super interesting to me. Maybe I just needed 10 more years before I thought it sounded interesting? My bad.
<hr>

#### To Kill a Mockingbird
One of those books that's easy to read and that you always hear about in one way or another. I didn't find it particularly life-changing, but certainly not bad. Deals with themes of childhood, bravery, racial issues, and justice, if I remember correctly.
<hr>

#### Things Fall Apart 
Oof. I don't remember much, but I do remember this book wasn't great for me. Maybe 10 years later I'd find it more interesting. I definitely do not have a copy on hand, though, and I'm not sure if I'm going out of my way to track one down, either. 
<hr>

# K-12 

Even worse, this will be a category of books I remember reading somewhere between Elementary School and High School, but were not part of "required" reading per se. Some books for children are incredible! So why omit them? I won't rate every single one of these 0-5 stars, the review is too unreliable for some of the fiction I read in childhood.

#### A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail
Listen to the audiobook. It's so good. Or read it, I don't care. Regardless, this is a hilarious book that you read when you need to talk yourself out of thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail. Don't bother with the movie made with the same title, though. It's not horrible, but the book is just so much better. Certainly one of my favorite books of all time.
<hr>

#### In a Sunburned Country
Unless you are Australian, you probably don't know anything about Australia. This is an amazing travel book that covers all things Australia. It's hilarious and totally engrossing. Like any Bill Bryson book - the audiobook is even better!
<hr>

#### Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10
I believe I read this on vacation. It's a gripping read.
<hr>

#### Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier
A book to remind you of how insane humans are, and how lucky you (likely) are to be born somewhere safe. The book recounts the authors childhood journey as a child soldier. Humans are capable of both incredible evil, and incredible kindness. Redemption is always within reach, and even against seemingly insurmountable odds - we all can persevere. This is one of those books you read to remind yourself that life is brutal, and from that brutality we (hopefully) learn some important lessons about life, and humanity.
<hr>

#### The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America
I sort of skimmed over the World Fair bits, and only read about H.H Holmes. Great murder novel if you do it that way!
<hr>

#### A Short History of Nearly Everything
In my top 5 books of all time. This is purely a science book...except in a way its very ELI5 (explain it like I'm 5) in the way it approaches complicated subjects with Bill Bryson's mastery of writing in an easily approachable way. If you want a book to sit down, lose yourself in, and marvel at the wonders of the universe, Earth, and the human body - look no further. The audiobook read by Bryson is also incredible.
<hr>

#### Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100
I don't remember anything about this book other than I definitely read it.
<hr>

#### The Black Hole War: My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum Mechanics
I don't remember anything about this book other than I definitely read it on a cruiseship.
<hr>

#### Worldwalk
A great travel book, probably inspired my interest in the AT later in life. Interestingly, this book is out of print? I still have it sitting on my bookshelf. You can grab a copy for like $5 on eBay.
<hr>

#### Miracle in the Andes: 72 Days on the Mountain and My Long Trek Home
A simultaneously crushingly depressing and amazingly inspiring and hopeful book. The writing is precise, and throughout the pages you must remind yourself everything you are reading is a true story. Not light reading, but certainly recommended.
<hr>

#### Water for Elephants
Unfortunately I think all my memories of this book were replaced by memories of the movie made from the book instead. It was a decent book, certainly better than the movie? 
<hr>

#### Black Duck
A book about rum running or something. I believe I just grabbed this quickly to have something to read for credit in a class?
<hr>

#### The Thief Lord
Wonderful book, although my memory about it is a little fuzzy.
<hr>

#### Adventures of a Young Sailor Series
I read "Powder Monkey" as well as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&rh=p_66%3A9781582346762">Prison Ship: Adventures of a Young Sailor</a> and actually remember Prison Ship more than the first novel. Apparently, I never read the 3rd book called "Battle Fleet". The series follows a young British sailor on his adventures on land and sea.
<hr>

#### Castaways of the Flying Dutchman Series
"Castaways of the Flying Dutchman" was an interesting book by one of my favorite authors. I also read  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&rh=p_66%3A9780142402856">"The Angel's Command"</a>, but I never read the 3rd novel "Voyage of Slaves".

If I recall, follows a mute boy who survives the sinking of the flying Dutchman and then...does stuff. I really don't remember, but I remember liking the series!
<hr>

#### Redwall Series
Unfortunately, I can't put all the covers of the Redwall series here otherwise we'd have too many pictures for reasonable length. So I chose my favorite cover instead.

I read so many of these books growing up: Redwall, Mossflower, Mattimeo, Mariel of Redwall, Salamandastron, Martin the Warrior, The Bellmaker, Outcast of Redwall, The Pearls of Lutra, The Long Patrol, The Legend of Luke, Lord Brocktree, The Taggerung, Triss

And apparently, there are several more I never read! Maybe I should revisit the series one day. Such a great set of books from a wonderful author.
<hr>

#### Hatchet Series
Once again, a classic series for me as a child. I read Hatchet, Brian's Winter, The River, Brian's Return, and Brian's Hunt and loved each one. Of course, my two personal favorites were Hatchet and Brian's Winter.
<hr>

#### Roald Dahl Novels
Although I haven't read everything by Dahl, I certainly read a few  of his most prominent work: Matilda, The BFG, The Twits, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, James And The Giant Peach

Of course, like everyone, my favorite was the BFG.
<hr>

#### The Dark Is Rising Sequence
This is a weird one, I'm very certain I read "Over Sea, Under Stone" at least three times, and I know I've read "The Dark is Rising" and "Greenwitch", but I can't remember if I ever finished "The Grey King" or "Silver on the Tree" oh well, memories lost to time. A great series.
<hr>

#### Inkheart
I know I read Inkheart, but I don't have any memory of finishing the trilogy. I didn't even know there was a Trilogy, isn't that funny? These books I read before I really knew how to use the internet, or books I'd forgotten about by the time the series was completed (Eg. book 3 was publihsed in 2010, but I probably read this in 2005?).
<hr>

#### Pendragon Series
I read so many of these: "The Merchant of Death", "The Lost City of Faar", "The Never War", "The Reality Bug", "Black Water", "The Rivers of Zadaa", "The Quillan Games", "The Pilgrims of Rayne".

Unfortunately, by the time the last two came out, "Raven Rise" and "The Soldiers of Halla", I had lost interest in the series and/or forgotten.

I still think about "The Lost City of Faar", and "The Reality Bug" sometimes. So good.
<hr>

#### Percy Jackson and the Olympians
I demolished this series. Don't ever watch the movie, it's terrible. The books are super good, though. 
<hr>

#### Tunnels Series
I remember loving "Tunnels", I remember enjoying "Deeper" as well, and then I remember not so much enjoying "Freefall" ... this series didn't hold me for its entire 6 book run. I'm actually impressed it got all the way to book #6. The first novel is great though!
<hr>

#### The Inheritance Cycle
I've read "Eragon" at least three times. I've read "Eldest" twice, "Brisingr" once and...never even started "Inheritance" - I'm not really sure why. One day I may finish this series. It is good, but you know, life.
<hr>

#### Harry Potter
Sort of goes without saying, I've every Harry Potter. Who hasn't? Once again, I've selected my favorite book from the series as the cover image.One interesting note perhaps, is that I've only read each book exactly once. I've never returned to re-read. Maybe I should?
<hr>

# Other Titles
I can't possibly do an entry for each book I read while very young. But I can remember a few of the titles!
