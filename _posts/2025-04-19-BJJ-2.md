# The Pandemic Killed My BJJ Momentum
If you read my first post [Year 1 Review](https://brendanhiggins.dev/miscellaneous/BJJ/) you may recall I never got my 2nd white belt stripe due to COVID. Well, as you can expect, COVID did a lot more than delay the stripe. It essentially shutdown the gym for months, and during that time, I moved away from Pleasanton/Dublin back to SoCal. Then from SoCal, to GA. Essentially, I took a 4 year break where I got busy with life and came up with lots of excuses not to go to BJJ again.

Finally, I signed up at a new gym - [Ascension Mixed Martial Arts](https://ascensionmma.com/) in March 2024.

# The First Class (Again)
I considered going to the first class with my 1 stripe, but decided ultimately to basically demote myself. My 1 year of experience, 1 stripe, and ~60 classes from Dublin may as well have been 10 years ago, not 4. I had forgotten almost everything besides the names of positions, the warmups, and a few very basic moves. 

#### Timeline 2024-2025
* March 2024 - White Belt 
* June 2024 - Green Belt
* Dec 2024 - Blue Belt ! 
  * March 2024 - Blue Belt Stripe 1

# The Academy & Instructors
Fortunately, I can only say positive things about the gym I picked - Ascension. The facilities are clean and utilitarian, basically all you can ask for with BJJ. The owner, [Junior Assuncao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BAnior_Assun%C3%A7%C3%A3o), is friendly, understanding, and has world class experience as an MMA fighter. All of the other professors/coaches are similarly excellent. 

Interestingly, this gym rewarded a green belt (not just for children) instead of using stripes for white belts to denote progress toward blue. So my green belt was essentially a white belt with 3-4 stripes on it when I received it. However, as of Jan 2025 the gym no longer gives green belts for adults and instead switched to the more commonly used system of awarding stripes for white-belts, so I guess I was in the last "Batch" of people to get an adult-green from this gym. Which is fun because I thought the green belt looked cool.

# The Journey - Year 2
Even though I noe have my blue belt in BJJ, I still feel like I'm finding my footing – maybe I got it a little earlier than I expected. I think a few things contribute to this feeling:

* Often being one of the physically smaller guys definitely presents a different challenge when rolling.
* My approach in class is more about learning and having fun than being super aggressive. Sometimes I prioritize exploring different positions and seeing what my training partners are working on, even if it means getting tapped.
* I'm not a natural at BJJ, and that's perfectly alright with me. Everyone progresses at their own pace, and I'm also not getting any younger (though I'm not old per se...).
* I definitely experience some imposter syndrome – I know I'm capable, but sometimes it just doesn't feel that way on the mats.

# Misc
I don't have any new musings on recovery, supplements, or hygiene from my year 1 post. The only "new" bit of equipment I can comment on is that I sometimes use an "Under Armour Gameday 3-Pad Tanktop" under my rashguard that that has some very minor padding along the ribs/spine. Wearing a padded shirt probably seems kind of lame on paper, but a few weeks into the new gym I got a floating rib injury from a rough knee-on-belly/ribs that messed me up for two weeks. If a bit of padding on my ribs prevents that again and means I can train more, then I'm wearing my rib pads and nobody can tell me otherwise. It offers no real competitive advantage in the gym, so it is what it is.

I also kind of gave up on wearing contacts, I just run off to the edge of the mats and throw on my glasses if I can't see what's going on with the instruction.
