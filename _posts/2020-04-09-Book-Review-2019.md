Just an excellent SciFi novel. I recommended.

An excellent read, and although it may seem like a Military book, it's really a business book. Valuable lessons for leadership as well as being the member of a team.

I understand that 'The Martian' is a tough book to follow for Weir. This wasn't good, though.
The setting was well thought out, and the writing was fine. The science was great. The plot was half-way decent as well.

So why the lower rating?
The dialog was horrible, and the protagonist was not well written. Andy (a man), is perhaps not great at writing a female lead. And the female lead was supposed to be Muslim..? But I didn't get that from the book at all. I'm not sure, the protagonist feeling weirdly written + having terrible intra/inter personal dialog killed the book a bit for me.

There's definitely better scifi books out there. 'The Martian' is one of them! Go back to something like that Andy!

I read this entire book on a flight from North Carolina to California. It was cool. I think Tyson is a bit full of himself, but the topics were fine. I've read books like this in the past, so the information was nothing particularity over exciting for me. It was a great refresher, though. Not something I can see a lot of people reading, though. It may come across as a little boring and science-y. If you're into that (I am), then it's good.

<!-- The Three-Body Problem -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">The Three-Body Problem</div>
The "Remembrance of Earth's Past" or "Three-Body Problem" series is perhaps my favorite SciFi series of all time (currently).

It consists of three novels: "The Three-Body Problem", "The Dark Forest", "Death's End"

Each novel is excellent, but my personal favorite was "The Dark Forest." I won't write a crazy review, just know I really liked these!

<!-- Bradbury Stories: 100 of His Most Celebrated Tales -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">Bradbury Stories: 100 of His Most Celebrated Tales -- DNF ❌</div>
This is a collection of short stories. I've read maybe a 1/2 of them? I'll slowly finish it when I just want to read 10-15 pages rather than a whole book.

I always fail to finish Anthropology books.
