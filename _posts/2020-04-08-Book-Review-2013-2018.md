This was a pretty rough period of "reading" in life for me. I was busy with college, then with a new job, so I didn't find much time to read for pleasure.

<!-- What the Dog Saw: And Other Adventures -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">What the Dog Saw: And Other Adventures</div>
Well, it's Malcolm Gladwell so it was decent. The first Gladwell book I ever picked up.
</div>
<br>

<!-- Flyboys: A True Story of Courage -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">Flyboys: A True Story of Courage</div>
Excellent WWII narrative of pilots, especially around the Pacific Theater.
</div>
<br>

<!-- The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History</div>
Great WWII story about the location and preservation of Axis looted artifacts.
</div>
<br>

<!-- A Walk for Sunshine: A 2,160 Mile Expedition for Charity on the Appalachian Trail -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;"> A Walk for Sunshine: A 2,160 Mile Expedition for Charity on the Appalachian Trail</div>
I read this as part of my "I'm going to do the AT" reading. It's fine for what it is.
</div>
<br>

<!-- Digging For The Truth -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">Digging For The Truth</div>
A sort of "History Channel" look at archeology. Not bad, but not good either.
</div>
<br>

<!-- AWOL on the Appalachian Trail -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;"> AWOL on the Appalachian Trail</div>
I don't remember much about this book other than it was enjoyable. Excellent if you are interested in the AT. Otherwise, maybe not worth the time.
</div>
<br>

<!-- The Martian -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">The Martian</div>
A wonderful sci-fi book. I would actually recommend this to someone looking to jump into the sci-fi genre for the first time because it's relatable, funny, well written, bordering on "hard science fiction" (full of technical detail), and has a big budget Hollywood movie to dip your toes into first.
</div>
<br>

<!-- Ghost in the Wires: My Adventures as the World's Most Wanted Hacker -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">Ghost in the Wires: My Adventures as the World's Most Wanted Hacker</div>
I read this shortly before I started my undergraduate Cybersecurity degree. From what I understand Kevin Mitnick is a bit of a jerk. Regardless, the book was entertaining and the wild cyber-infused goose chase Mitnick gave the FBI is super interesting to read about. I'd recommend this to anyone who finds exploiting technology, and white-collar crime interesting.
</div>
<br>

<!-- Midnight Rising: John Brown and the Raid That Sparked the Civil War -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">Midnight Rising: John Brown and the Raid That Sparked the Civil War</div>
So good. An amazing bit of pre-Civil War history.
</div>
<br>

<!-- The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey</div>
I don't remember much about this book, but Teddy Roosevelt was certainly a bad ass.
</div>
<br>

<!-- The House on the Borderland -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">The House on the Borderland</div>
I listened to this book while on an Internship. Thank you, William Hope Hodgson, for giving me something to do 100+ years after you published this book.
</div>
<br>

<!-- Isaac's Storm: A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">Isaac's Storm: A Man, a Time, and the Deadliest Hurricane in History</div>
An excellent historical fiction novel about the 1900 Galveston hurricane. Riveting.
</div>
<br>

<!-- The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">The Art of Deception: Controlling the Human Element of Security</div>
Maybe the best book on social engineering I've ever read (also pretty much the only one). I don't have a ton to say here other than I'd only recommend this book if you are interested in cybersecurity. It might be a nice educational book for your older family members to teach them about the dangers of Phishing/Scam phone calls, perhaps?
</div>
<br>

<!-- The Art of Intrusion: The Real Stories Behind the Exploits of Hackers, Intruders and Deceivers -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">The Art of Intrusion: The Real Stories Behind the Exploits of Hackers, Intruders and Deceivers</div>
I honestly have no memory of this book. I remember reading it while I studied for my CEH. I guess it was good enough to finish, but not good enough to remember. That might be unfair, though, since I consume a decent amount of cyber* related information. It might have just been lost to the noise.
</div>
<br>

<!-- The Killer Angels: The Classic Novel of the Civil War -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">The Killer Angels: The Classic Novel of the Civil War</div>
An absolute classic - highly recommended historical fiction novel.
</div>
<br>

<!-- How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life</div>
A fairly generic self-help book. I don't recall any messaging or lessons-learned from this. It didn't strike me as bad, though.
</div>
<br>

<!-- The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies</div>
I don't really remember anything about this book, other than I read it quickly on a flight. I read it because Flynn was the incoming Natl. Security Advisor and was curious about his position on things. Sort of interesting how things turned out...
</div>
<br>

<!-- Dispatches from Pluto: Lost and Found in the Mississippi Delta -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;"> Dispatches from Pluto: Lost and Found in the Mississippi Delta</div>
Sort of makes you wan to move to Mississippi? But also, not want to move there ever. Schrodinger's Mississippi.It's a fun travel book, with interesting history!
</div>
<br>

<!-- The Khan Dynasty -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">The Khan Dynasty Series</div>
I read three of the "Khan Dynasty" Series (Conqueror Series) back-to-back: 
  <ul>
    <li>Genghis: Birth of an Empire</li> 
    <li>Genghis: Lords of the Bow</li>
    <li>Genghis: Bones of the Hills</li>
  </ul>
Unfortunately, I did not get around to reading "Empire of Silver" or "Conqueror: A Novel of Kublai Khan" although I really should!
</div>
<br>

<!-- 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos -- DNF ❌</div>
I think I only made it ~1/2 through the book. I may revisit.
</div>
<br>

<!-- The Gulag Archipelago Abridged -->
<div style="outline: 2px solid black;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;">The Gulag Archipelago Abridged -- DNF ❌</div>
So depressing. I'll revisit this, but I only got about 1/2 through before I got distracted by other novels.
