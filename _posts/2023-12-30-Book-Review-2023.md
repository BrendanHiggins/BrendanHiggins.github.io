<ul>

<li>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</li>

Which includes 4 novels, and 4 collections of short stories (44 in total). For more details, please see the Wiki for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_of_Sherlock_Holmes" target="_blank">Sherlock Canon</a>

Given that this includes nearly all Sherlock canon, I can firmly say I loved just about every minute. There are certainly some stories that standout more than others, but over time I really came to appreciate the character of Watson and Sherlock very much. 

There's something utterly captivating about the world of Sherlock Holmes. Arthur Conan Doyle tells tales of such intricate mystery, each clue a hint toward a greater hidden finale that is often hard to predict (Albeit not always). Holmes himself, with his razor-sharp wit and genius with his trusty companion Watson is just as fun in book format as it can be on the big screen. But it's not just the genius that drew me in; it's the adventure. Every case plunges them into a fresh labyrinth, from foggy moors to opulent mansions, each step brimming with danger and intrigue. However not every story takes place in some London back-alley, but instead many stories almost entirely take place within Sherlocks sitting room -- mysteries solved fireside with brandy and a tobacco. It's really no wonder these are considered classics and nearly single-handedly established the modern detective genre we have today.

    <td colspan="3">Mixed feelings on this one; not as good as "Circe". I found Patroclus to be a fairly passive and uninteresting narrator. I was captivated with the story of Achilles and the Trojan war which the book did cover well, but since so much of the story does revolve around Patroclus I have to knock it a few points because his thoughts/viewpoints didn't interest me as much as the hypothetical thoughts/viewpoints might have been from Achilles Point-of-view. Still a pretty solid read overall.</td>

With that being said, it was really strange because it sort of felt like two entirely separate books between Part 1 and Part 2, which I found a little jarring. Characters were fun, mostly believable, and the writing was generally quite descriptive which is always a bonus. You won't find a book around with more Beignets being consumed alongside people being skinned alive.</td>

An intense, dark, and very long novel. It's a post-apocalyptic tale of a deadly virus that wipes out most of humanity spread across three "books" within the novel. I was pleasantly surprised with the book and found the themes of good vs evil very interesting and an unexpected backdrop for a novel that I assumed was just about a biological accident of horrid proportions so to speak. Not a light read, not a fun read, but an excellent read.

I went into this book expecting a fun and lighthearted story about teenagers hunting ghosts, but I was surprised by the depth of the plot and the emotional impact of the story. The book is ultimately a story about nostalgia, loss, and the power of friendship and family. While it is certainly a fun read, it is also a moving and thought-provoking exploration of the human condition; loss and grief.

The story is one of desperation, isolation, and hopelessness. The dark plot line is surprisingly sci-fi for a mystery/suspense novel, but it works well to highlight the themes of good and evil, as well as the strength of the human spirit. I enjoyed the focus on family bonds, and I found the book to be a quick and enjoyable read that was hard to put down.

This somewhat generic fantasy novel has it all: love, violence, action sequences, betrayals, death, plot twists, and cheesy dialogue. If you're looking for a fun and generic fantasy read, this is the book for you.

Really not my favorite. I found the "gimmick" of the novel was not worth the payoff at the end. I enjoyed less than 3/6 of the stories in the book...so for that, 2/5. Never seen the movie, maybe it's good?

Circe is a unique approach to Greek mythology that tells the story of the witch Circe from her own perspective. The novel is full of life, love, family, death, loneliness, and finding one's inner strength.

I was not familiar with the myth of Circe before reading this novel, but I was quickly drawn into her story. Miller does an excellent job of weaving together the threads of mythology and creating a believable and relatable character.

Circe is a complex and fascinating character. She is strong, independent, and intelligent, but she is also vulnerable and flawed. She makes mistakes, but she learns from them and grows as a person; ultimately finding her own inner strength. I highly recommend it.    </td>

The Terror is a novel by Dan Simmons that tells the fictionalized story of the 1845 Franklin Expedition, a British naval expedition that disappeared in the Arctic. Simmons adds his own twist to the story that adds an oppressive layer of suspense and horror to the novel, and I especially appreciated how well he was able to blend these historic and fictitious events. The result is a novel full of cold, dread, and misery. It's not exactly "scary" but undeniably grim. It's a hell of a journey, and I would recommend this book to anyone.

The characters in The Terror are well-developed and believable. The reader can feel the fear and desperation of the crew as they are trapped in the Arctic. Simmons does an excellent job of creating a sense of claustrophobia and isolation, and he makes the reader feel as if they are right there with the crew, experiencing everything they are experiencing. It is a story about survival, hope, and the human spirit. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, horror, or adventure stories.
