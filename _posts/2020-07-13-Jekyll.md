Starting up a Jekyll Blog to replace Ghost CMS.
<!--more-->
In early April 2020, in the midst of the developing COVID-19 Pandemic, I decided to learn some new things - including Google Cloud Platform (GPC). I ultimately stood up a Ghost CMS blog on a GCP Compute Engine (VM). It was fun, but ultimately ended up being too heavy for what I wanted and the compute for the VM was expensive.

To save some <i class="fas fa-dollar-sign"></i>, this Jekyll blog on GitHub pages seems like the route to go. I did fool around with setting up Jekyll in a GCP bucket for static website hosting, but ran into some issues that just seemed annoying. Github pages it is - it works well!
