Reading More.
<!--more-->
I was playing around with this new blog.

Seemed like a good time to start reviewing books. Not so much for other people to read. Instead, to keep myself honest about how much reading I do. An attempt at persuading myself to read more often. To form a habit, backed up by a blog.

This all was loosely based on this video -
<iframe width="1432" height="715" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lIW5jBrrsS0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

So, with these things in mind it seemed logical to use this blog as a place to 'journal' my reading.

So I came up with a few different posts:

The format rendered weird on previews, too. Shame.
<table>
<thead>
<tr >
<th>Which Included</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Author: This Cute Little Format</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Finished: <i style="color:#33cc33;" class="fas fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rating: <i style="color:#ffcc00;" class="fas fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i><i style="color:#ffcc00;" class="fas fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i><i style="color:#ffcc00;" class="fas fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i><i style="color:#ffcc00;" class="fas fa-star-half-alt" aria-hidden="true"><i style="color:#ffcc00;" class="far fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i></i></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

That I came up with to add book entries. Neat, right!

Super neat, but also - a ton of overhead.
So I deleted all of it.
