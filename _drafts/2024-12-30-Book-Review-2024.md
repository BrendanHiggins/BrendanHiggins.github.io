    <td colspan="3">A book about walking around. There's a character who walks around in the woods, a character who walks around a city, a character who LIMPS around a city, and a character who walks around a desert. These characters all eventually meet up with a few other characters and eventually converge on one another where the proceed to have some conversations about things happening in the world. Eventually, there's some action seqeunces in the last 1/6th of the book and overall sets up a very strong foundation for the rest of the trilogy (I assume). However, as a book, it's just a bit ... okay. I shouldn't complain, it's a perfectly fine fantasy story, just feels like a huge setup which is lackluster unless you continue the trilogy.</td>

    <td colspan="3">Pure comedy - I did not expect this book to be as funny as it turned out to be. The premise of bigfoots attacking a remote (and stranded) neighborhood probably doesn't sound funny, but the execution certainly is. The book is told very seriously, and very realistically however there are some things that I just could not get over. Like the fact that nobody in the story owns a single tool of anykind (why would they?) Also I don't know if it was on purpose but Brooks made every character a total sterotype in one way or another which added to the humor. Overall, a highly highly entertaining story. Just don't take it too seriously!</td>

    <td colspan="3">A classic - I've always wanted to read this one. It's incredibly long, has a complicated plot, has about 75 characters to keep track of, and is written like a classic. So it's not the easiest read ever, but it's certainly not the worst. A story of love, loss, justice, revenge, pity, remorse, depression, strength, power, wealth, weakness, hope, trust, forgiveness, and betrayal. It's a book that has a little bit of everything where you're certainly rooting for Edmond for the entire journey.</td>

    <td colspan="3">A post apocalytpic and dystopian book filled with blue butts, futuristic genetics, wild boar (kind of), sex slavery, and people generally being awful. Writing is excellent. The characters all suck, none of them have any redeeming qualities what-so-ever which makes it a painful book. It's a unique approach to the usually overdone "end of the world" books you run into. Unsure if I'd puruse the sequels.</td>

    <td colspan="3">Unfortunately just not a good book. I expected a first contact story about hyper-evolved octopus being basically alien creatures. You do get that, but it's buried beneath a vague dystopian/scifi setting, scientists exploring the octopus as slow as possible, an android, corporations doing corporation stuff, a guy trapped on an AI ship, and a mind-hacker being chased by government spies or something. That all probably sounds cool but it's just straight up not? Most of the side storylines just feel irrelevant to the overall story. It's pacing is slow, it's setting is weird, it's just a strange book that I honestly didn't enjoy very much.</td>

    <td colspan="3">Overall a fun fantasy story but nothing too serious. The biggest issues is the book suffers from convenient writing constantly having you say "oh really it worked perfectly just like that, huh?" and is often a bit hard to believe what is happening. Second, all of the characters are 17-20 years old or so, but their dialog and skills sets would lead you to believe they are 35+ and grizzled war veterans or something of the sort. Bit unusual...still, not bad.</td>

    <td colspan="3">A bit like Steelheart by by Brandon Sanderson which I read in 2022. A novel about "superheroes" of a sort, but more like the show "Heros" on NBC back in 2016 where "Ordinary people around the world discover they have super powers." but with a darker twist. The novel was "fun" and very easy to read quickly; however, upon closer examination it had more plot holes than a book printed on pages of Swiss cheese. So at the end of the day was it bad? No. was it super good? Also no. </td>

    <td colspan="3">This was actually a rare DNF turned "Finished" from 2020 where I stopped reading as I became "bored with the story"...this time I approached the book on audible and was able to get through it. Unfortunately, it was still somewhat...boring? The book is written very well and the author is clearly very talented, it reads a bit like a biography of a real person which is impressive considering it's fictional, albeit historic fiction. It's a novel about resilience and perseverance, good and evil, love, kindness, and compassion, togetherness and loneliness, ingenuity and bravery, and ultimately the slow march of time. There's potentially a lot to unpack in a novel like this, and I can see why it's held in high regard by many. Unfortunately for me, I just needed a few more Michael Bay explosions to hold my SciFi addicted attention I guess. I did finish it, and the ending was excellent so I can't complain. </td>

    <td colspan="3">Perhaps thankfully I never watched "The Expanse" on Amazon Prime, so I went into this novel blind to the TV show adaptation. In general, it's a really solid space murder-mystery drama book, I guess? There's space ships, air recyclers, murders, a love story,  nukes, and alien pathogens. If you like fairly realistic space SciFi and some of those things I just listed then you'll likely enjoy this. Plus if you love it, there's a whole lot of sequels!  </td>

    <td colspan="3">A collection of short stories by different authors that require different ratings. Ignore the 0/5 as I'll rate each on their own.
    
* Ark by Veronica Roth - A, not bad. Touching in many ways and a bit sad.
* Summer Frost by Blake Crouch - A, I actually quite enjoyed this even if it comes across as a black mirror script.
* Emergency Skin by N.K. Jeminsin - A, quite comical and the unqiue point of view / narrator writing is sort of refreshing and interesting.
* You Have Arrived at Your Destination by Amor Towles - C, Amor is a great writer, maybe the best of this bunch; but this story is fine but nothing special for me.
* The Last Conversation by Paul Tremblay - D, I just didn't really enjoy this one. It's fine? It's...too slow?
* Randomize by Andy Weir - B, a fun ocean's 11 style scifi story with only 4 characters or so...

    <td colspan="3">A collection of very short stories from Andy Weir. They're all...bad? I mean they're all about 5 minutes long but almost immediately I realized every story just was written for a quirky little twist ending that sort of made it less fun than it should have been for some reason. Given the low time investement required it'sfine but also not something I'd go out of my way to recommend. Ignore the 0/5 as I'll rate each on their own.
    
* Access - C, just sort of silly
* Antihypoxiant - B, pretty fun actually
* Annie's Day - A, my favorite of the collection for no reason
* The Real Deal - F, meh
* Bored World - C ,it's fine I guess
* The Midtown Butcher - C, again, silly
* Meeting Sarah - F, meh
* The Chef- F, meh
* The Egg- B, the title story is good if not a bit of an overplayed concept</td>
