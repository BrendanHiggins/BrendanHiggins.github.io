    <td colspan="3">A collection of short stories by different authors that require different ratings. Ignore the 0/5 as I'll rate each on their own.
    
* Ark by Veronica Roth - 4/5, not bad. Touching in many ways and a bit sad.
* Summer Frost by Blake Crouch - 5/5 I actually quite enjoyed this even if it comes across as a black mirror script.
* Emergency Skin by N.K. Jeminsin - 5/5 quite comical and the unqiue point of view / narrator writing is sort of refreshing and interesting.
* You Have Arrived at Your Destination by Amor Towles - 3/5 Amor is a great writer, maybe the best of this bunch; but this story is fine but nothing special for me.
* The Last Conversation by Paul Tremblay - 2/5 I just didn't really enjoy this one. It's fine? It's...too slow?
* Randomize by Andy Weir - 4/5 a fun ocean's 11 style scifi story

    <td colspan="3">A collection of very short stories from Andy Weir. They're all...bad? I mean they're all about 5 minutes long but almost immediately I realized every story just was written for a quirky little twist ending that sort of made it less fun than it should have been for some reason. Given the low time investement required it'sfine but also not something I'd go out of my way to recommend. Ignore the 0/5 as I'll rate each on their own.
    
* Access - 2/5 just sort of silly
* Antihypoxiant - 4/5 pretty fun actually
* Annie's Day - 5/5 my favorite of the collection for no reason
* The Real Deal - 1/5 meh
* Bored World - 3/5 it's fine I guess
* The Midtown Butcher - 2/5 again, silly
* Meeting Sarah - 1/5 meh
* The Chef- 1/5 meh
* The Egg- 4/5 the title story is good if not a bit of an overplayed concept</td>

    <td colspan="3">An interesting book with some fun scifi especially around time dialation. It has sort of a low-point about 2/3rd through the book but thankfully it picks up again for a good ending. No major complaints beyond a weird fixation from the author on the potential homosexuality of humanity (not a joke).</td>
