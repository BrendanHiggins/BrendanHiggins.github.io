Having never seen the film, I went in to this novel sort of blind beyond knowing it's considered a classic SciFi novel. It did not start the way I expected, and It did not end the way I expected. I really enjoyed the middle of the book the most, but some of the ending portions lost me a little bit. A philosophical space adventure that might also have some unexpected religious motifs.    </td>

An intense, dark, and very long novel. It's a post-apocalyptic tale of a deadly virus that wipes out most of humanity spread across three "books" within the novel. I was pleasantly surprised with the book and found the themes of good vs evil very interesting and an unexpected backdrop for a novel that I assumed was just about a biological accident of horrid proportions so to speak. Not a light read, not a fun read, but an excellent read.

I went into this book expecting a fun and lighthearted story about teenagers hunting ghosts, but I was surprised by the depth of the plot and the emotional impact of the story. The book is ultimately a story about nostalgia, loss, and the power of friendship and family. While it is certainly a fun read, it is also a moving and thought-provoking exploration of the human condition; loss and grief.

The story is one of desperation, isolation, and hopelessness. The dark plot line is surprisingly sci-fi for a mystery/suspense novel, but it works well to highlight the themes of good and evil, as well as the strength of the human spirit. I enjoyed the focus on family bonds, and I found the book to be a quick and enjoyable read that was hard to put down.

This somewhat generic fantasy novel has it all: love, violence, action sequences, betrayals, death, plot twists, and cheesy dialogue. If you're looking for a fun and generic fantasy read, this is the book for you.

Really not my favorite. I found the "gimmick" of the novel was not worth the payoff at the end. I enjoyed less than 3/6 of the stories in the book...so for that, 2/5. Never seen the movie, maybe it's good?

Circe is a unique approach to Greek mythology that tells the story of the witch Circe from her own perspective. The novel is full of life, love, family, death, loneliness, and finding one's inner strength.

I was not familiar with the myth of Circe before reading this novel, but I was quickly drawn into her story. Miller does an excellent job of weaving together the threads of mythology and creating a believable and relatable character.

Circe is a complex and fascinating character. She is strong, independent, and intelligent, but she is also vulnerable and flawed. She makes mistakes, but she learns from them and grows as a person; ultimately finding her own inner strength. I highly recommend it.    </td>

Not exactly "scary" but undeniably oppressive? The cold, dread, and misery of the story really stand out to me when thinking back on this novel. It's a hell of a journey, and I would recommend this book to anyone. I especially appreciate the way Simmons seamlessly blended real history with fictitious events resulting in a truly unique read.

The Terror is a novel by Dan Simmons that tells the fictionalized story of the 1845 Franklin Expedition, a British naval expedition that disappeared in the Arctic. The novel is full of cold, dread, and misery, and it is a truly unique read.

Simmons does an excellent job of blending real history with fictional events. The novel is based on the actual events of the Franklin Expedition, but Simmons adds his own twist to the story that adds an oppressive layer of suspense and horror to the novel, and it makes the story even more unforgettable.

The characters in The Terror are well-developed and believable. The reader can feel the fear and desperation of the crew as they are trapped in the Arctic. Simmons does an excellent job of creating a sense of claustrophobia and isolation, and he makes the reader feel as if they are right there with the crew, experiencing everything they are experiencing. It is a story about survival, hope, and the human spirit. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, horror, or adventure stories.
