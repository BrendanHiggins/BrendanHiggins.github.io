A set of characters way too large that you can easily lose track of who (mostly) have no impact on the story. I did enjoy the descriptions of the setting, and some of the ideas here were great (lot of Dune / Warhammer 40k Vibes) but unfortunately I just personally feel the execution was not great. I don't plan on reading the sequels.</td>

The plot is basically that an evil Jeff Bezos type wants to buy an Old Lady's land, but she doesn't want to sell and somehow comes into contact with a sea creature/alien. I won't give away more than that, but the story is pretty wild, bloody, has a lot of body-horror and graphic descriptions of mutilation and death. For a short novel of only 220 pages it's actually a pretty good story for what it is.</td>

    <td colspan="5">Probably my least favorite out of the trilogy, which is funny considering it's the final novel. It's not a bad book per se, and the differing points of view provides some much desired back-story and explanation to questions left unanswered from the previous two books. Again, I wouldn't say it was a bad novel, but I think it's just hard to "end" a story was broad and mysterious as the Southern Reach Trilogy set's up. Tall order.</td>

    <td colspan="5"> I read Annihilation in 2021, and finally finished up the Southern Reach Trilogy this year. Authority was a very different novel from Annihilation. I liked it just as much, but if Annihilation was a SciFi, adventure, thriller this was more like a bureaucratic, mystery, thriller? This book reminded me of the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_(video_game)" target="_blank">Control<a/> a ton! Which is a good thing, lots of SCP (Secure Contain Protect) vibes, great tie into the previous novel. Also, I found the creepiness/horror of this book actually greater than that of Annihilation</td>

Having never seen the film, I went in to this novel sort of blind beyond knowing it's considered a classic SciFi novel. It did not start the way I expected, and It did not end the way I expected. I really enjoyed the middle of the book the most, but some of the ending portions lost me a little bit. A philosophical space adventure that might also have some unexpected religious motifs.    </td>

An intense, dark, and very long novel. It's a post-apocalyptic tale of a deadly virus that wipes out most of humanity spread across three "books" within the novel. I was pleasantly surprised with the book and found the themes of good vs evil very interesting and an unexpected backdrop for a novel that I assumed was just about a biological accident of horrid proportions so to speak. Not a light read, not a fun read, but an excellent read.

I went into this book expecting a fun and lighthearted story about teenagers hunting ghosts, but I was surprised by the depth of the plot and the emotional impact of the story. The book is ultimately a story about nostalgia, loss, and the power of friendship and family. While it is certainly a fun read, it is also a moving and thought-provoking exploration of the human condition; loss and grief.

The story is one of desperation, isolation, and hopelessness. The dark plot line is surprisingly sci-fi for a mystery/suspense novel, but it works well to highlight the themes of good and evil, as well as the strength of the human spirit. I enjoyed the focus on family bonds, and I found the book to be a quick and enjoyable read that was hard to put down.

Circe is a unique approach to Greek mythology that tells the story of the witch Circe from her own perspective. The novel is full of life, love, family, death, loneliness, and finding one's inner strength.

I was not familiar with the myth of Circe before reading this novel, but I was quickly drawn into her story. Miller does an excellent job of weaving together the threads of mythology and creating a believable and relatable character.

Circe is a complex and fascinating character. She is strong, independent, and intelligent, but she is also vulnerable and flawed. She makes mistakes, but she learns from them and grows as a person; ultimately finding her own inner strength. I highly recommend it.    </td>

Not exactly "scary" but undeniably oppressive? The cold, dread, and misery of the story really stand out to me when thinking back on this novel. It's a hell of a journey, and I would recommend this book to anyone. I especially appreciate the way Simmons seamlessly blended real history with fictitious events resulting in a truly unique read.

The Terror is a novel by Dan Simmons that tells the fictionalized story of the 1845 Franklin Expedition, a British naval expedition that disappeared in the Arctic. The novel is full of cold, dread, and misery, and it is a truly unique read.

Simmons does an excellent job of blending real history with fictional events. The novel is based on the actual events of the Franklin Expedition, but Simmons adds his own twist to the story that adds an oppressive layer of suspense and horror to the novel, and it makes the story even more unforgettable.

The characters in The Terror are well-developed and believable. The reader can feel the fear and desperation of the crew as they are trapped in the Arctic. Simmons does an excellent job of creating a sense of claustrophobia and isolation, and he makes the reader feel as if they are right there with the crew, experiencing everything they are experiencing. It is a story about survival, hope, and the human spirit. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, horror, or adventure stories.
