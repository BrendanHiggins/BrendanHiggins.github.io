The setting and plot is generally pretty good. Maybe a 7/10? However, much of the dialog is like a 2/10, and sort of made me cringe at times. Also, the character is sort of a male mary sue. He's just some random kid who happens to be really good at everything he does, with his character quirk being <i>bad at making metaphors</i> ? Super strange...but It wasn't the worst thing I've ever read.

An excellent  novel, not as good as the first Jurassic Park book, but nonetheless a great follow-up. I tried to watch the 2nd Jurassic park movie after the novel, and turn it off 20 minutes in. How did hollywood butcher a movie based on a good book so badly?

Interesing commentary from Malcolm, the only returning character from J1. More T-Rex and Raptor fun!

A fun non-fiction biology read about the gut. The book discusses your jaw, your spit, your stomach acid, your shit, and your colon. From fun facts, to gross facts, to interesting historical tid-bits it's an easy read and keeps your attention easily. Author also blends science and humor very well.

I had this on my "to read" SciFi list for a while, and finally got around to it. It's a good book, albeit slightly more "boring" than I was anticipating. The book is somewhat ruined (in my opinion) by an extreme exess of quotes. Since the book was published in 1972 all the quotes range a bit, but none of them really "fit" into the novel since it mostly takes place in 2025...so having quotes dated from the 1960's being dropped into the story in 2025 is...unusual? It was really taking me out of the novel so I literally started skipping the quote "blocks" in the story.
<br>
Seriously, they should publish a copy of this that doesn't have any of those weird quote sections in it. Maybe one or two quotes at the beginning of a chapter, but there's dozens of pages of JUST quotes. Very strange.
<br>
The book itself is thought provoking, and despite spanning ~100 years in the story itself, the author did fairly well to avoid specifics that wouldn't age well (Eg. the computer "Room") which we all know would be a cellphone well before 2025. Anyway, despite that, It's a decent read and not terribly long so worth your time if you're interested in first contact style stories. (Just don't expect it to be about Aliens - it's 99% about humans).

Better than the movie(s) by a mile. It seems all three movies borrowed elements from the first book which was interseting to see.

A fun read, written well as it is afterall Crichton. Some very intriguing concepts relating to science, progress, and man's manipulation of nature. In that sense, it almost has a Frankenstein vibe to it as an undertone of "man messing with things they don't think about fully."

Sort of like a fantasy blend of Lord of the Rings, real life Roman history, and Avatar: The Last Airbender? It's fine, it reads like a fairly generic adult fantasy book. There's some action, some adult concepts, and some magic n' monsters like you would expect. Not bad, but not "good" either per se. Totally readable, though if you're looking for something like this.
<br><br>
Edit 1: I also went ahead and read the sequel - Academ's Fury: Codex Alera, Book 2 (9780441013401). It was pretty good! The story certainly keeps interesting but it's also still somewhat generic and predictable in my opinion.
<br><br>
Edit 2: I also went ahead and read the next book as well, Cursor's Fury: Codex Alera, Book 3 (9781841497464). I won't comment too much, but the series is pretty good overall. I'll probably finish all 6 eventually, the only thing to note is that the formula seems to be repeating a bit. There's 2 or 3 parallel story lines occuring that all loosely interelate, and just when everything seems hopeless a miracle happens and all your "Good Guys" win. It's a happy ending every time. That's fine, just sort of interesting way to write a story.
