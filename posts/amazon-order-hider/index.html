    <h2>Amazon Archived The Archive Feature</h2>
<p>My wife and I share an Amazon account. This isn't exactly a controversial take; we share a house, a last name, and money. So sharing a Prime subscription on my Amazon account is an obvious choice. For years, this has never caused an issue. The only &quot;problem&quot; was what to do with the purchase of a gift. Whether it was a birthday, an anniversary, or Christmas if we found something on Amazon we wanted to buy one another, we could go for it thanks to one feature - the humble and crucial &quot;Archive Order&quot; button. This little button was the guardian of gifting. It was a simple, effective solution. Of course, you could peek at the archived orders anytime you wanted...but we had a mutual agreement that we wouldn't do so.</p>
<p>Sadly, the feature is no longer available.
<img src="/static/images/amazon-hide-order/amazon-9.png" alt="amazon-9" title="amazon-9"></p>
<p>Amazon quietly euthanized the archive feature. It's gone. Vanished.
Now, sadly, all orders are visible at all times, with no option to hide them.</p>
<p>Amazon suggested, instead, that you setup an &quot;Amazon Household&quot; account.
<img src="/static/images/amazon-hide-order/amazon-8.png" alt="amazon-8" title="amazon-8"></p>
<p>Which honestly...? This probably works well but ... I don't <strong><em>want</em></strong> to do that. I want to be able to hide the occasional gift order from within my account.</p>
<p>So, being stubborn...</p>
<h3>The Extension</h3>
<p>The solution, of course, is a chrome extension. It's a client-side fix, essentially a digital piece of duct tape. Sadly, this fix won't work on the mobile app, so it is an imperfect solution, but a solution nonetheless.</p>
<p>The extension is as simple as it looks, you can punch in an amazon order # and after refreshing the page, the order will be <em>gone</em>. The whole order element is designated <code>display: none;</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/amazon-hide-order/amazon-2.png" alt="amazon-2" title="amazon-2"></p>
<p>This extension is so minor and silly I'm not actually going to bother to upload it to the Chrome Web Store, etc. But you can download it <a href="https://github.com/BrendanHiggins/amazon-order-hider">here on my github</a>.</p>
<p>To install it, clone the the git repo somewhere locally on your PC. Then, head to <code>chrome://extensions/</code> and turn on developer mode.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/amazon-hide-order/amazon-7.png" alt="amazon-7" title="amazon-7"></p>
<p>Once you're in developer mode you can &quot;Load Unpacked&quot; and select the folder containing the code.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/amazon-hide-order/amazon-5.png" alt="amazon-5" title="amazon-5"></p>
<p><img src="/static/images/amazon-hide-order/amazon-1.png" alt="amazon-1" title="amazon-1"></p>
<p>And you're done!</p>
<p>Of course, this extension might break if the format of the amazon order page changes in the future. So I may have to update it with each change to the orders page, and I may do that, or I may not. Either way, it was fun to make an extension which I had never done before.</p>
<h3>In Conclusion...</h3>
<p>Sometimes, for the customer, simplicity is best. Or, in a weird way, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better">worse is better</a>. Software (in this case, a website) that has simple, but rich features is better for the user.</p>
<p>In some ways, removing archive did make Amazon more simple. One less button for the customers to think about, right? I'm sure Amazon had a reason for removing it, for example by nudging users toward the &quot;Household&quot; account system, the platform can likely build a more personalized experience based on individual profiles (ads). Additionally, perhaps the separate profiles can more easily hide things like search history which is one way a gift could be ruined.</p>
<p>But like I said, I don't <strong><em>want</em></strong> to do that.</p>
<p>RIP Archive 🪦, I'll miss you.</p>
