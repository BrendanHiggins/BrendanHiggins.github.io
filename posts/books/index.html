        <h1>Books - A Blogging Journey</h1>
        <p><small>Published on Apr 06 2020</small></p>
    </header>

    <p>I was playing around with this new blog, and it seemed like a good time to start reviewing books. Not so much for other people to read per se, but instead to keep myself honest about how much reading I do. An attempt at persuading myself to read more often. To form a habit, backed up by a blog.</p>
<p>This all was loosely based on this video -</p>
<div class="overflow-auto">
    <iframe 
    class="responsive-video"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lIW5jBrrsS0" 
    title="YouTube video player" 
    frameborder="0" 
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
    allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
</div>
<br>
<p>So, with these things in mind, it seemed logical to use this blog as a place to 'journal' my reading.</p>
<p>I'm also going to be &quot;okay&quot; with not finishing a book. I'd rather read something I enjoy, so If I'm not finding joy in the book, I fully plan on putting it down. Hopefully, this strategy leads to more books read, and less time &quot;procrastinating&quot; about something I'm supposed to enjoy. As a kid, I loved reading and constantly chewed through books - especially when given dedicated &quot;reading time&quot; in school.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nobody gives you dedicated reading time as an adult, so I'm going to attempt to actively carve time out for it. Wish me luck!</p>

<p>TL;DR I need to do more reading before I die!</p>

I've bounced around a lot on how I score books, but this is how I currently do it: <a href="https://bulletbook.club/profile/higgins" target="_blank">Book Reviews</a></p>
